    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.). You've learned that two of the most common approaches in supervised learning are regression and classification. In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. **Wherever the documentation link is provided, click on the links and read the documentation!** Careless reading and skipping instructions are major sources of making mistakes and losing points in your assignments. Also note that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension."

    "<b>Course Policy Reminder</b>\n",
    "Debugging the codes and error resolution are ALWAYS the students' responsbility regardless of the source or the cause of the error. This policy will be enforced in email communications and the office hours. Keep in mind that all assignments are individual graded tasks. Any collaboration with other students is strictly prohibited and is considered as cheating. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must run ALL cells** and get the correct outputs for all cells and give complete answers to all questions. **Cells/codes with no output get zero!**\n",

    "\n",
    "Wherever needed, you should replace `...` elipsis with your code.\n",

    "`...` may indicate one or more lines of missing codes. Some outputs are provided to you to use as reference and to verify that your output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Effect on Grade**: Preprocessing steps are so critical in each part and you should pay special attention to make sure that you do all preprocessing steps correctly. That is why the reference outputs have been provided in preprocessing steps. Your notebook would become ineligible for grading implementation parts if you have wrong results/outputs of preprocessing, so be extremely careful with all preprocessing steps. "

    "- **Q4** [2 points]- Check the `best_rf` performance scores and explain whether or not fine-tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearch` helped resolve the performance issues with this imablanced dataset. Explain why COMPLETELY. You must justify your answer and make arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: The tuning did not help resolve the issues because the problem was not with the model but with the dataset. When there are only 50 positive instances in a dataset with over 1000 datapoints then the model is going to reach the learn that there is almost never a positive case and that is what is seen in the results."

    "ANSWER: You can determine which curve has a better performance by checking the area under the curve. In this case the random forest has a better performance."

    "\n",
    "ANSWER: The curves display a relatively decent peformance which contrats heavily with the previous scores particulalry recall which would probably be the best performance measure. This is probably because most of the error is in the form of false negatives which are not included in the roc curve."
